  <h3>Geographic Information Systems Application Specialist</h3>
  <h1>Ashley Allan</h1>  
  <hr />
  <p>I'm a recent Graduate based in Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p>
  <p>My passion lies within nature. Many hobbies and interests that I have are based in the wilderness of the Great White North. 
    There is nothing that I find more fulfilling than planning my next excursion.</p>
  <p>Born and raised in the Greater Toronto Area, my experience and knowledge of nature was limited to the suburban lifestyle I lived. 
    The excitement and curiosity that I developed for nature and science remained to exist only in theory, satisfied by the books and documentaries I 
    would immerse myself in. It wasn't until I relocated to Northwestern Ontario that I had the opportunities and resources to finally explore my passions 
    through experiences and education.</p>
  <h2>Education</h2>
  <!--LinksOption Begin-->
  <p>My academic career began at <a href="https://www.confederationcollege.ca/">Confederation College</a> in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where I received my Diploma in 
    Forest and Ecosystems Management. During the time I spent studying at Confederation College, I had the co-operative opportunity to work with both the 
    <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-natural-resources-and-forestry">Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry</a> and Greenmanlte Forest Inc. The 
    positive experiences and practical skills acquired from these placements were key in the solidification of my desire to pursue a career in Forestry.</p>
  <p>After graduating from Confederation College, I decided that the right choice on my career path was to specialize in an area of study that I was not only 
      fascinated by, but challenged by as well. This lead me to the Geographic Information Systems Application Specialist program at 
    <a href="https://flemingcollege.ca/">Fleming College</a> in Lindsay, Ontario, where I received my Postgraduate Certificate.</p>
