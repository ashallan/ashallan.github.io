  <h1>Skills</h1>
  <hr />
  <h2>Web Design and Programming</h2>
  <p>Explain how information requests flow between a client and server. Create efficient and error 
    free content using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Critique accessibility 
    of web content using design standards and applicable laws. Generate custom websites containing 
    cartographic gata products using libraries and templates. Assemble reusable web markup and code 
    to make content. </p>
  <h2>Geovisualization</h2>
  <p>Describe and apply fundamental techniques used to retain a high degree of positional and attribute 
    accuracy while capturing, structuring and displaying geographic data. Procure, interpret, transform, 
    and integrate data from various sources, in different formats, data compilation scales and coordinate 
    systems, to create cartographic products that effectively communicate at a variety of scales. Create 
    maps and visual displays based on recognized cartographic design principles that communicate geographic 
    information effectively. Proficiently employ industry standard software packages used in organizations 
    that rely on GIS and cartographic products. Produce an advanced cartographic product from planning to 
    data acquisition to implementation using cartographic design principles and by integrating multiple 
    software platforms to effectively communicate cartographic information to a wide audience. Describe how 
    cartographic skills are being used to support decision making processes in government, commercial, 
    consulting, and other organizations.</p>
  <h2>Spatial Analysis</h2>
  <p>Compare and select the most appropriate data model and GIS analysis method for a given problem at an 
    introductory level. Describe and perform basic GIS analysis with a variety of different data models 
    using appropriate geoprocessing techniques. Develop work flows to accomplish specific objectives and tasks 
    at an introductory level. Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different 
    formats and coordinate systems, to solve spatial problems. Apply geoprocessing techniques using a model builder 
    to solve spatial problems. Effectively perform and complete a Spatial Analysis real world project scenario 
    from data acquisition to pre-processing to analysis using a variety of geoprocessing techniques to explore 
    and analyze spatial problems; develop and automate workflow solutions; and validate and present results. Using 
    professional and technical language of GIS describe how spatial analysis techniques can be used in industry with 
    respect to their economic and social importance and their future potential.</p>
  <h2>GIS Database Principles</h2>
  <p>Demonstrate how to efficiently organize and prepare data for a GIS. Create efficient queries to perform 
    calculations and manipulate stored data. Create custom forms, reports and interfaces for end users. Transfer 
    data between a database and other applications. Design a simple conceptual model for a relational database for 
    a given problem.</p>
  <h2>Remote Sensing and Image Analysis</h2>
  <p>Contrast the electromagnetic regions for base and thematic mapping applications. Use Industry standard remote 
    sensing software to extract information. Interpret spectral target properties to extract thematic information 
    from imagery. Construct workflows to register satellite and airborne imagery to earth coordinates.Apply traditional 
    and digital photogrammetric techniques.	Implement image classification approaches. Design image enhancement and image 
    filtering strategies. Describe colour theories and Image fusion enhancement approaches.</p>
  <h2>Problem Solving and Programming</h2>
  <p>Apply fundamental design techniques to solve simple programming computational and logic problems in a spatial context. 
    Write documentation that explains program design and operation using a standard method. Implement in code algorithmic 
    solutions to problems using a high level programming language. Use variables, constants and lists appropriately for the 
    storage, manipulation and processing of text and numeric data. Apply structured programming constructs, such as selection, 
    repetition, and functions to direct the flow of program execution and to write modular programs. Write data to and read 
    data from files in order to transfer data between applications and create reports. Design and use classes for modelling 
    the data and functionality of objects specific to the domain of a problem or application. Use error handling and testing 
    to identify and correct programming errors (syntax, run-time and semantic) in order to ensure the successful execution of 
    programs. Collaborate positively and equitably with a team to develop and implement a plan that programmatically automates 
    a spatial process</p>
  <h2>Surveying and CAD Mapping</h2>
  <p>Apply the basics of field measure for a given surveying project to map the dimensions of the land. Complete basic 
    adjustments of survey data using the principles of elementary plane surveying so that the information can be used in a GIS. 
    Apply CAD skills to produce maps with graphic attributes and organize elements using overlapping map layers to represent 
    field work. Use COGO (coordinate geometry) skills to calculate, measure, and analyze existing and new field data and determine 
    data quality of field work. Understand how to handle surveying tools and equipment appropriately, in-compliance with industry 
    safety and operating standards.</p>
