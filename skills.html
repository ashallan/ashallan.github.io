    <p>My academic career began at Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where I received my Diploma in 
    Forest and Ecosystems Management. During the time I spent studying at Confederation College, I had the co-operative opportunity to work with both the 
    "Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry" and a smaller Forestry company "Greenmanlte Forest Inc". The positive experiences and practical skills acquired 
    from these placements were key in the solidification of my desire to pursue a career in Forestry.</p>
    <p>After graduating from Confederation College, I decided that the right choice on my career path was to specialize in an area of study that I was not only 
      fascinated by, but challenged by as well. This lead me to the Geographic Information Systems Application Specialist program at Fleming College in 
      Lindsay, Ontario, where I received my Postgraduate Certificate.</p>
